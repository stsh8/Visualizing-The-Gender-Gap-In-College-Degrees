# Visualizing-The-Gender-Gap-In-College-Degrees

In this guided project, we'll extend the work we did in the last two missions on visualizing the gender gap across college degrees. So far, we mostly focused on the STEM degrees but now we will generate line charts to compare across all degree categories. We'll explore how to export the final diagram we create as an image file.
